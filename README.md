## Using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to Create a Lyric Generator for Punk Rock Music
### Background Information
The idea for this project is to create a lyric generator based off of  punk rock music. The Long Short-Term Memory neural network trained on a set of punk rock artists from the AZ Song Lyrics Dataset found on <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/albertsuarez/azlyrics'>Kaggle</a>.

The LSTM can write lyrics in the style of the following 15 artists:
        
- All Time Low
- Dashboard Confessional
- A Day to Remember
- Good Charlotte
- Green Day
- Jimmy Eat World
- The Menzingers
- My Chemical Romance
- Paramore
- Simple Plan
- State Champs
- Story of the Year
- The Story So Far
- Taking Back Sunday
- Yellowcard


### The Model
<img src = 'https://github.com/nguyenbel/punk-rock-lyric-generator/blob/main/imgs/punk_rock_model.png'>
The LSTM model takes in two inputs: the song lyrics and the respective artist of the song. 

In order for the model to take these two inputs, for the lyrics, we first tokenize the lyrics columns of the dataframe and fit the string version of each song to the text, then convert the tokenized text to a sequence, and, finally, created an n-gram padded sequence for each song (length of 11). For the artists, we stripped the white spaces for each artist/band so they were read as a single string, tokenized and fit the artists to the text, and, finally, converted the tokenized text to a sequence and appended that to a list which we later changed to a Numpy array.



### Results
Using Google's Colaboratory cloud computing environment, I was able to run 100 epochs to train my model. As pictured in the graph, the model becomes just a little more accurate at predicting the words as we increase the number of epochs.

To measure whether or not the model wrote lyrics similar to the given artist, I used TextBlob's sentiment analysis and specificially looked at the polarity number, which measures how positive or negative a message is and ranges from -1 to 1. If the polarity is negative, then the message is negative and the closer it is to -1, the more negative the message. If the polarity is positive, then the message is positive and the closer it is to +1, the more positive the message. A polarity of 0 indicates that the message was neutral.

I chose 4 differennt artists to see how my model did with writing in their style for the lyric "There's a place off Ocean Avenue." I compared the predicted polarity with the full lyrics (including chorus repetition) of one of the bands' hit songs.

#### In the style of All Time Low

For the band All Time Low, my model didn't capture their sentiment too well. The predicted polarity for the lyrics generated by the model was a -0.5 whereas the lyrics for their hit song "Dear Maria, Count Me In" had a polarity of 0.09.

#### In the style of A Day To Remember

For the band A Day To Remember, my model did a decent job capturing the sentiment of A Day To Remember. The predicted polarity for the lyrics generated by the model was a -0.5 whereas the lyrics for their hit song "The Downfall of Us All" had a polarity of -0.05.

#### In the style of My Chemical Romance

For the band My Chemical Romance, my model did a decent job capturing the sentiment of My Chemical Romance. The predicted polarity for the lyrics generated by the model was a -0.15 whereas the lyrics for their hit song "Teenagers" had a polarity of -0.26.

For the band Yellowcard, my model did a decent job capturing the sentiment of Yellowcard. The predicted polarity for the lyrics generated by the model was a 0.7 whereas the lyrics for their hit song "Ocean Avenue" had a polarity of 0.2.

### Conclusion
Although the lyrics that are generated don't make much sense grammatically, based on the sentiment analysis, the model does a good job at creating the lyrics in the style of each artist (in terms on the polarity of each artist). This model may not be able to create a song for Billboard's Top 100 Singles, but it is a fun way to help us relieve some of our teen angst!

### Future Direction
- Refine model
    - Make outputs more currated to the artist whose writing style we are supposed to immitate
    - Make the lyrics make some grammatical sense
- Add more artists and song lyrics for variety
    - Potentially scrape the web for more lyrics and artists/bands.
